    "The table given provides the data of the Construction Statistics from Approved Building Permits. There are 24 columns in total. The data is not easily understandable due to the structure of the data. For instance, the column \"Total Number\" is the summation of units constructed, in which case, it only includes the \"Residential number\", \"Non-Residential Number\", \"Additions Number\" and \"Alterations/Repairs/Renovations Number\". The \"Demolitions Number\" and \"Street furnitures... Number\" is not included in the Total, but the fact that it is written beside the other columns makes people assume that it is included. The same applies for the \"Total Floor Area\" and the \"Total Value\". Furthermore, since the table claims to provide statistics, the nature of the data is mostly numeric. However, there are a lot of missing values (full columns and rows that contain \"..\" instead of 0s). It is also important to note that the column headers also contain excess dots. In order to clean and transform the data, the empty rows and columns should be dropped and removed from the data set. Additionally, the header should be uniformed in such a way that it no longer contains excess dots. \n",
